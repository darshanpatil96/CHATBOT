# CHATBOT
An AI-powered chatbot built with Flask and TensorFlow/Keras. It uses a trained deep learning model (chatbot_model.h5) to classify intents from user messages and respond accordingly. The project includes a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) for a clean chat interface and is deployment-ready with a Procfile and requirements.txt.
